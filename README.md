This repository tracks the progress of my personal home lab setup.

The project began with my growing interest in cybersecurity. I realized that even the largest organizations can make mistakes, potentially exposing them to zero-day vulnerabilities. As the digital world expands, software systems become increasingly complex, requiring more time, effort, and maintenance to ensure they remain secure and efficient.

To gain hands-on experience and deepen my understanding of this field, I decided to create my own home lab. The world of software is full of powerful tools and technologies, and while they can be intimidating, I believe that starting small and mastering the fundamentals is key to long-term growth and improvement.

Thus, I began building a home lab that integrates a variety of software solutions and applications to help with everyday tasks, while providing a platform for learning and experimentation in the realm of cybersecurity.
